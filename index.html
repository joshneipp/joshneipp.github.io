            <h2>What is Career Coaching?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Career coaching is professional guidance and support as you discover, design, and thrive in your career. </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>Career coaching is professional guidance and support as you discover, design, and thrive in your career.   -->
              <h3>It can be very specific, such as:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>LinkedIn profile review</li>
                <li>Resume and cover letter review</li>
                <li>Interview practice to ace that interview</li>
                <li>Negotiation tactics</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Or, it can help when you’re just not sure what’s next.  Maybe you’re wondering:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Should I make a career switch?</li>
                  <li>Which career am I best suited for?</li>
                  <li>Which careers are out there that I haven’t even considered?</li>
                  <li>How much time do I want to spend at home and how much time do I want to work?</li>
                  <li>Should I go back to school?</li>
                  <li>Should I launch my own business?</li>
                  <li>Can-I-pull-this-off?</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Or maybe you’re feeling stuck in a rut and you don’t even know what you want to change. Maybe you’re going through the motions thinking you’re doing everything you “should,” but something still feels off.</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>What are my values and what am I uniquely suited to do?</li>
                <li>How do I pursue a career change and still cover my finances in the meantime?</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Or maybe you’re in the exact right place, and you just want some extra momentum.</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>What’s the best way to improve an important skill related to my role?  </li>
                  <li>Tackle performance challenges on my team?</li>
              </ul>
